intro: |
  I am an open systems specialist with 30 years experience working in technology. I have primarily worked with Linux, but have worked across a broad range of technologies thereon: Docker, Kubernetes, Swarm, Ansible, Puppet and currently with Rancher. My experience with enterprise infrastructure has provided a tremendous base for bringing the robustness of HA servers into the world of DevOps through automation and orchestration.  <br/><br/>
  I enjoy system building, and integrating these into the current CI/CD workflows. With a good Product Management focus and an adherence to Agile practices, we can come up with solid solutions to intriguing problems.  <br/><br/>
  I have worked in large scale consultancy roles across North America as well as a mix of support experience (including Enginnering support roles) that has provided me with a deep understanding of the technology landscape.
